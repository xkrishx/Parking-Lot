# Parking-Lot
Multiple Entry Parking Lot: Design parking lot system with below features
Contains 'n' parking slots in a linear manner with some of these slots designated as entries. Both 'n' & 'entrySlots' are provided during the parking lot initialisation.
Once initialised, the parking lot can hold 'n' different vehicles at any given time with one vehicle in each slot.
Currently, there are different types of vehicles like a Truck, Car, Bus which comes to the Parking Lot. Each slot in the Parking Lot can accommodate any type of vehicle.
Each vehicle is uniquely identified by its registration number however it has other additional properties like colour, make..etc.
Once the system is initialised with input size 'n' & 'entrySlots', it should support a series of the following operations in an interactive mode (commands on command line/commands through input file).
Operations:
park (entrySlot, vehicleType, registrationNo, colour, make) - should assign the nearest free slot from the entry. When there are multiple slots with the same distance, parking in any of them is accepted.
unpark (registrationNo)
status - should print the parkingLot status showing all the occupied slots (and the vehicle information) and free slots.
search [vehicleType] [registrationNos] [colour] [make] - Only one of search parameters is mandatory. registrationNos could be a list. Should search for the slots with the vehicles which satisfies the search.
Example: Let's say there is a parking lot with 100 slots and slots 1,10,20...100 designated as entry slots. * Now when a vehicle comes in through slot-10, it needs to be parked at 10. * Another vehicle comes in through slot-10, it can be parked either at 9 or 11 (any slot is fine). * Third vehicles coming in through slot-10 need to be parked at 9 or 11 depending on the above. * Let's say another vehicle comes in through slot-10 after a long time (by which slots 1-80 are all filled out), this vehicle needs to be parked at 81. * So on..
